# Cloud9-Angular-2-Launch-Script
Launch script for running Angular 2 projects in the Cloud9 online IDE.

These are two simple files that will create and run or, simply, run an app named `first-app`.

Here is the source code for creating and launching `first-app`:
```
cd
ng first-app
ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Here is the source code for launching `first-app`:
```
cd
cd first-app
ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Once again, there's nothing difficult about this, but it's a good reference to have or a nice set of files to keep in your repositories.
